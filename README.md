1 from the visualization above we see that we have more people flodding into Hospital X from regions known to have economic hub while we have less people coming in from poorer regions.

2 Another observation is the hospital x is sited in an area where there is already economic growth so we have more people coming in from economic hubs,  the areas considered under developed have a very high populace as well but the distance between their region and hospital x is far, another factor is the level of education. as they are not highly educated which can lead to the irrelevance of medical test and the need of a proper hospital to them.

# Possible methods to tackle constraint
1 sensitization programs in the under developed regions telling and demonstrating the importance of medical check ups, and consulting a medical doctor.
2 creating another branch of the lab in between the under developed and the developed areas that way the issue of long  distance is resolved and that will also host the team responsible for sensitization programs.

 # Analysis on  the age distribution of patients who have come to the hospital for testing
